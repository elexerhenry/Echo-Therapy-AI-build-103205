# Echo-Therapy-AI-build-103205

WARNING!

Echo AI is NOT a licensed therapist, and if you're going through something emotionally, you should seek a licensed professional.

Notes:

1. Echo Therapy AI is currently in Beta and is not finalized yet.
2. Echo Therapy AI has not been completed yet, and cannot answer every single question you might have for Echo.
3. Echo Therapy AI is purely used for entertainment purposes, and is not a real therapist.
4. Echo Therapy AI is not an actual AI, it is simply a program backed up with pre-programmed questions & answers.



READ THIS:

Echo Therapy AI will be backed up with a Google Gemini API key for it to use. This will make Echo able to respond to virtually any question. However, the API key has not been recieved yet, so Echo cannot answer virtually any question. I will update this Read Me, and Echo once I have recieved the API key.

For now, enjoy this underwhelming experiment!
